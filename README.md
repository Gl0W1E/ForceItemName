# How It Works:
The plugin checks for items with default names (example: apples named "Apple") through multiple events (picking up, opening chests, crafting) and renames them to the config's liking.
# Example config:
```yaml
podzol: "Chocolate Dirt"
golden_apple: "Yellow Apple"
golden_carrot: "Rotten Carrot"
```
